Each run produces the following output files:

* stamp

Indicates that the run is complete.  Skip any run directory that does
not have this file.


* bad

Indicates that there was some sort of problem collecting a feedback
report for this run.  Skip any run directory that has this file.


* client

Directory containing various files from the client's perspective.  The
client here is Rhythmbox and the script that directly launches
Rhythmbox.  They are the client of a virtual X server.


** client/initial-song

The song that Rhythmbox was instructed to play first.  Rhythmbox
automatically continues in shuffle mode, so you cannot assume that
this was the song that was playing at the time of failure.


** client/outcome

The exit status or signal for the run.  0 indicates successful
completion.  Values between 1 and 255 indicate crash due to a fatal
signal, where the value is that signal number.  Values of 256 and up
indicate completion with a nonzero exit status.  Divide by 256 to get
the exact status.


** client/reports.gz

Compressed raw feedback report.  This is complete data, with no
downsampling.  If you decide to downsample, you may want to save those
files in this same subdirectory so that other people can use them too.

The following recipe may be useful for downsampling raw reports:

    % zcat reports.gz |
    /moa/sc1/cbi/sampler/tools/decimate-samples 100 >reports-100.gz

The decimation tool takes an optional random number seed, but will
select a good default from system entropy sources if none is provided.


** client/stdout
** client/stderr

Logged standard output and error streams from the Rhythmbox
application.


* server

Directory containing various files from the server's perspective.  The
server here is a virtual X server the script that launches it.


** server/outcome

The outcome of the X server in which the Rhythmbox client was run.
Contains a descriptive word followed by a detail number.  Possible
values include:

    - normal 256: correct, clean shutdown.  This typically indicates
      that the underlying Rhythmbox client exited without crashing.

    - premature 256: clean shutdown but before the expected time.
      Since the server exits early if its client goes away, this
      typically indicates that the client crashed.

    - sigterm 15: X server refused to quit in a timely manner and was
      therefore killed using SIGTERM.  Typically indicates that the
      Rhythmbox client process was still alive but hung.

    - sigkill 0: X server had to be destroyed with extreme prejudice.
      Something must have gone very, very wrong.


** server/play-time

Length of time Rhythmbox was allowed to play before being asked to
quit.  Might be interesting to know whether longer play times
correlate with greater likelihood of failure.
	

** server/stdout
** server/stderr

Logged standard output and error streams from the virtual X server.
