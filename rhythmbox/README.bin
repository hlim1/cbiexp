Most of the scripts in the "bin" directory are not intended for direct
use by humans.  The two exceptions are:


* make-runs

This script can be used to generate additional runs if needed.  Use it
as follows:

	% make-runs [--jobs=<j>] <first> <last>

This generates runs numbered <first> through <last> inclusive, with up
to <j> in progress at any one time.  On an SMP, default job count is
number of CPUs minus one.


* categorize-runs

Print a list of run numbers along with a one-word outcome label.  This
script is intended to be used in pipelines to help identify good runs,
bad runs, broken runs, etc.  See comments at the top of the script for
more details.


* resolve-samples

An updated script for collating raw feedback report with static site
information.  Use this instead of the one in "/usr/lib/sampler/tools",
which is too old for our current data format.
