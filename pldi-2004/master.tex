\section{\placeholder{Future Work / Alternate Approaches}}

\placeholder{Page budget: \nicefrac{1}{2}.}

Our experience with \moss suggests several key areas for future
development.

In the experiments reported here, sampling is dynamically uniform:
each crossing of each instrumentation site has the same fixed chance
of being sampled or skipped.  However not all code is equally
interesting.  The details of a one-time configuration action may have
more impact on a bug than some bulk initialization loop that iterates
millions of times.  Two generalizations of our approach support
non-uniform sampling.

One might replace the single global ``next sample'' countdown with
several countdowns having a variety of means.  Each acyclic region
uses one of these counters for all of its sites.  Thus,
heavily-trafficked code might be sampled at a rate of
\nicefrac{1}{1000}, while moderate-use code uses \nicefrac{1}{100} and
rarely executed initialization and error-handling code uses
\nicefrac{1}{10} or even \nicefrac{1}{1} (i.e. no sampling; complete
data collection).

A complementary extension is to allow individual sites to decrement
the ``next sample'' countdown more than once.  Decrementing once is
equivalent to tossing a biased coin once and only taking a sample if
that toss comes up (e.g.) heads.  Decrementing twice simulates taking
a sample if either of two tosses comes up heads.  For a basic
underlying countdown with mean $d$, decrementing $n$ times yields an
effective sampling rate of $(1 - (1 - \frac{1}{d})^n)$.  For purposes
of checking countdown thresholds at the tops of acyclic regions, a
site that decrements $n$ times is equivalent to $n$ sites that
decrement once.  Thus each global ``next sample'' countdown actually
supports a family of sampling rates selectable on a per-site basis.

\placeholder{The above assumes that we have already given a refresher
  on global countdowns and threshold checks earlier in the paper.
  Rewording will be needed if we don't get into that amount of
  detail.}

\placeholder{Yet to be addressed: how you actually decide what rate to
  use for a given site.  Presumably some mix of ad-hoc guessing,
  coverage information from in-house testing, and dynamic adjustment
  in the field based on what you're seeing in the feedback reports
  you've gotten so far.}

\placeholder{Yet to be addressed: need for better statistical models.
  This is a bit vague, but should at least discuss problems we
  encountered using logistic regression in the Moss experiment.}

\placeholder{Yet to be addressed: exploiting program structure.}

\section{Related Work}

\placeholder{Page budget: 1.}

\placeholder{In addition to related papers discussed in our own prior
  work, should also discuss:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Podgurski's ICSE 2003 paper
  \item that other rather older paper we all read; anybody remember
    the title?
  \item recent developments by anybody from the RAMSS workshop
  \end{itemize}}
