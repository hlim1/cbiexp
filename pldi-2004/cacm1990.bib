%%%                        The size of the original cacm.bib file
%%%                        covering 1958--1996 became too large (about
%%%                        4000 entries) for BibTeX and TeX to handle,
%%%                        so at version 1.44, it was split into
%%%                        cacm1950.bib, cacm1960.bib, cacm1970.bib,
%%%                        cacm1980.bib, and cacm1990.bib, each covering
%%%                        the decade starting with the year embedded in
%%%                        the filename.  Version numbers for these
%%%                        files begin at 2.00.
%%%
%%%                        Volumes from the 1990s average more than 200
%%%                        articles yearly, so a complete bibliography
%%%                        for this journal could contain more than 6000
%%%                        entries from 1958 to 2000.
%%%
%%%                        These bibliographies also include ACM

                 computation is attributable to the fact that it is an

                 high-level languages can be efficiently compiled on to
                 this model; yet it can be efficiently implemented in
                 hardware. The author argues that an analogous bridge
                 between software and hardware in required for parallel
                 computation if that is to become as widely used. This

                 model as a candidate for this role, and gives results

                 way of fostering reuse of this experience is by
                 establishing large collections of reusable object
                 classes. Resulting problems include: Class packaging
                 and class organization -- how can classes and their
                 methods be represented to simplify reuse. Class
                 selection and exploration -- what query and browsing
                 facilities are needed by developers in order to
                 facilitate software reuse. Class evolution -- how may
                 the class hierarchy be reorganized as a result of
                 changes introduced by developers. These issues are
                 illustrated by examining prototype tools and systems
                 intended to aid object-oriented programming.",

                 random input streams are fed into important UNIX
                 utilities on several commercial UNIX systems. In some
                 cases, the tests were able to crash the entire
                 operating system. In 1995, a (sadly, unpublished)
                 followup study showed that many of the failures
                 diagnosed in 1990 still had not been repaired in the
                 commercial systems, and that the GNU implementations
                 were generally more robust. Both 1990 and 1995 papers,

                 system that is used by researchers to analyze the
                 process of connecting multiple computers to produce the
                 illusion of one high-level timesharing system. The
                 Amoeba project was developed jointly by the Vrije
                 Universiteit and the Centrum voor Wiskunde en
                 Informatica, both in Amsterdam. The central goal of the
                 project is to design a distributed system that is
                 transparent to its users. Components include diskless
                 workstations, pool processors that can be allocated as
                 needed, specialized servers, and gateways that link
                 systems from different sites and even different
                 countries.",

                 system. Some timing measurements of the RPC mechanism
                 are provided also. This paper is a very good,
                 up-to-date overview of Amoeba.",
  keywords =     "design; experimentation; measurement; performance",
  notes =        "Amoeba is an operational distributed system based upon
                 the client-server model with a specialised RPC tuned
                 for good execution over LANs. The RPC requests to a
                 server for a remote operation can contain upto 30Kb of
                 data. Eight bytes are reserved in the header for the
                 common case when only a few parameters need be sent; in
                 this case, only a header is required. The user
                 processes in Amoeba 4.0 make use of stub procedures to
                 handle the marshalling of parameters and data and the
                 actual message passing mechanism from the users. An
                 Amoeba process is based on the use of parallel threads,
                 which all share the same address space but have their
                 own private stacks. Threads appear to application
                 programmers as traditional sequential processes with
                 the ability to communication among themselves using
                 shared memory. Scheduling of threads is performed by
                 code in the process itself, and so Amoeba threads are
                 effectively co-routines. Amoeba processes are
                 homogeneous in that they specify the required
                 instruction set of the processor on which they are
                 executed among the list of required resources in the
                 ``process descriptor''. Amoeba has the concept of
                 ``memory servers'' that will fetch remote code and data
                 memory segments based on their capabilities. For WAN
                 usage, Amoeba systems are treated as clusters which can
                 access each other through gateways called SWANs
                 (Service for Wide-Area Networks). The use of
                 broadcasting to locate services only operates within a
                 local Amoeba system and if services are to be made
                 available over a WAN, they must be published at the
                 SWAN. This prevents inadvertent use of remote resources
                 instead of local ones and also gives sites
                 administrative control over the services that their
                 users are providing on the wide area network. The
                 Amoeba RPC has a delay one sixth that of traditional
                 SunRPC and a throughput which is twice as good for user
                 process to user process RPC communications on otherwise
                 identical workstations (Sun 3/60s). The maximum user to
                 kernel bandwidth is certainly higher than the maximum
                 813 Kbytes/sec on the Sun 3/60 hardware, but the
                 communication overhead and kernel to user mode context
                 switches reduces this to a little over 700 kbytes/sec
                 for user process to user process communications.
                 ``Although it has long since been corrected, we made a
                 truly dreadful decision in having asynchronous RPC in
                 Amoeba 2.0. In that system the sender transmitted a
                 message to the receiver and then continued executing.
                 When the reply came in, the sender was interrupted.
                 This scheme allowed considerable parallelism, but it
                 was impossible to program correctly. Our advice to
                 future designers is to avoid asynchronous messages like
                 the plague.'' Amoeba 4.0 does not operate efficiently
                 on a network topology with a large number of local area
                 networks interconnected by many bridges and gateways,
                 mainly due the way port location and message handling
                 is performed.",

                 television and publishing. Integrated digital archives

                 Every branch of computer science will have a role in
                 this growing field and will contribute to the
                 development of digital multimedia systems. Interactive

  note =         "The system {PRIZ} has been under development at the
                 Institute of Cybernetics, Tallinn, Estonia since
                 mid-seventies. This article describes three
                 environments of different sophistication based on this
                 system: {ExpertPRIZ}, a simple expert system shell;
                 {C-PRIZ}, a language integrating imperative programming
                 ({C}); and {NUT} (New UTopist; {Utopist} was the
                 initial programming language of {PRIZ}), an
                 object-oriented environment.\\ Data elements in
                 {Utopist} (attributes of objects) can be bound by both
                 inter- and intra-object relations. These relations are
                 used by a propositional theorem prover to generate a
                 proof that it is possible to compute a certain datum
                 given some other data. This (constructive) proof is
                 used to synthesize a program which computes the datum.
                 So {PRIZ} has a quite non-standard logic component:
                 compile-time proof and program generation instead of
                 run-time clause resolution. These technique are called
                 Propositional Logic Programming and Structural Program
                 Synthesis. {NUT} is a prototype-based (as opposed to
                 class-based) language: any object can be used as a
                 template (type) for a new object (and of course as a
                 component of a new object). Limited polymorphism is
                 supported through a generic type ({\tt any}). It is
                 notable that some of the modern programming paradigms
                 (constraint programming, object-orientation, employing
                 logic in computation) have been considered so early",

                 designed to provide a unified programmatic interface to
                 both persistently allocated data (i.e., data that lives
                 beyond the execution of an application program) and
                 transiently allocated data (i.e., data that does not
                 survive beyond an application's execution), with
                 object-access speed for persistent data usually equal
                 to that of an in-memory dereference of a pointer to
                 transient data.",

                 algorithms have been experimentally evaluated. The

                 generates functions that approach the theoretical lower

                 common community) are described. The key feature is the

                 common meeting areas using a video connection (in this

                 are given complete control over the configuration,
                 evolution and use of the video system. The general goal

  abstract =     "The Touring Machine$^{TM}$ was implemented to provide
                 a common platform (system infrastructure) on which to
                 build distributed multimedia applications. A principal
                 goal is to separate policy from mechanism, both to hide
                 session management details from the application
                 programmer, and to provide flexibility in policy to
                 accommodate a wide range of applications. The user
                 (application programmer) is provided an API based on a
                 client/server model. The system structure is an object
                 model with both persistent objects (e.g., station
                 objects) and transient objects (e.g., session objects).
                 Multiport connections (called {\em connectors}) are
                 enabled by mapping logical {\em endpoints} to physical
                 {\em ports} (this can be done by clients via the API).
                 A name server acts as a central repository for static
                 and dynamic information about the system (e.g., for
                 locating station objects). Cruiser$^{TM}$ and
                 Rendezvous$^{TM}$ are two examples of applications
                 built on top of The Touring Machine System. In fact,
                 Cruiser sessions can be synchronized with Rendezvous
                 applications using the common underlying system
                 infrastructure.",

                 they ``win'' by splitting the gestures into three
                 phases: start position, dynamics, end position. The
                 dynamics are typically a direction of motion and / or
                 finger bending. Makes a good point about using tension
                 (a la Buxton) to phrase the gestures: start in a tense
                 state (you're explicitly indicating that you want to do
                 something) and end in a relaxed state (you naturally
                 relax your arm as a gesture comes to a close).",
