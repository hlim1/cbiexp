Creation of the overview pages is localized into one main file: create_overview_page.py.  This creates an application overview and a distribution overview.  The overview pages are generated by create{App, Dist}Overview(), which in turn generate pages for each application/distribution by calling create{App, Dist}Page().  Another function, generateCSS, creates a css file defining the highlighting for each application release.  The highlighting is determined by crash rate.  All other functions in create_overview_page.py are for processing and reorganizing data.

Beyond the above description, I feel that further documentation would be redundant, since create_overview_page is well-commented already, and it would be easier to see the documentation alongside the actual code anyway.

Known bug:
I have found that no links are generated to PLDI2005 results or George results for distribution pages.  A closer examination of createDistPage() is needed.  The bug is probably in the block starting at line 98.  Alas, I did not have time to hunt this one down.
