Guide to data files:

{mossbad,mossbad2}
    instrumented executables, preserved for posterity

{mossbad,mossbad2}.cfg
    extracted CFG info for use with "order-sites"

{mossbad,mossbad2}.sites
    extracted site info for use with "resolve-samples"

*/{good,bad,bad2}
    one subdirectory per variant moss executable

*/{good,bad,bad2}/command
    command line used for run

*/{good,bad,bad2}/stdout
    logged standard output from run

*/{good,bad,bad2}/stderr
    logged standard error from run
    includes "Error <n>" messages

*/{good,bad,bad2}/time
    wall clock execution time in seconds

*/{good,bad,bad2}/exit
    exactly one of the following:
        normal    <exit status>
        signal    <signal number>
        timeout

*/{bad,bad2}/reports
    feedback report suitable for use with "resolve-samples"

*/{bad,bad2}/fail
    zero if "stdout" and "fail" match corresponding good files
    arbitrary non-zero value if either of these are different

*/disregard
    reason why the entire triple of runs should be disregarded
