a configuration file has the following format:

first line: name of the programming language
This is used as a prefix of all names.

second line: name of the command line option for choosing the language

Each subsequent line has a rule, which is one of
four forms:

keyword		by itself, generates a rule to match that keyword
name regexp	generates a rule to match regexp; the token is "language_name"
. regexp	generates a rule to match regexp; the token is the same as the previous line
ignore regexp	generates a rule to ignore all matches of a regular expression regexp

Remember:

- rules are listed in priority order
- for lines with two fields, the fields must be separated by a single tab
- the gen program also adds some default rules for ignoring whitespace and treating any unmatched
	characters as a special token "OTHER"
