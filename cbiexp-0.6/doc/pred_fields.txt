A predicate is displayed in the following format:

<stats> <name> <fun> <file:line>

<stats>     provides a graphical and textual summary of the behavior of
            the predicate in the runs.

            The graphical summary is in the form of a multi-colored band:

            -- The length of the band denotes the total number of runs in
               which the predicate is observed to be true.

            -- The length of the black portion of the band denotes the
               probability that the program will crash when the line of
               code on which the predicate occurs is reached.

            -- The length of the white portion of the band denotes
               1 - (the probability that the program will crash when the
               predicate is observed to be true).

            -- The length of the (red+pink) portion of the band denotes
               the increase in probability that the program will crash
               when the predicate is observed to be true over the
               probability that the program will crash when the line of
               code on which the predicate occurs is reached.
               Longer pink portions mean that there is more uncertainty
               in how much the probability that the program will crash
               increases when the predicate is observed to be true.

            The textual summary is viewable by pointing the mouse cursor
            anywhere on the band, for instance:

            Context: 18% Lower Bound: 51%, Increase: 68%, Fail: 86%,
            true in 3 S and 18 F runs

            -- The predicate is observed to be true in 3 successful and
               18 failing runs.  The number of such runs (21) corresponds
               to the length of the band.

            -- Context corresponds to the black portion of the band.

            -- (100 - Fail) corresponds to the white portion of the band.

            -- Increase = (Fail - Context) corresponds to the (red+pink)
               portion of the band.

            -- Lower Bound corresponds to the red portion of the band.

<name>      is the name of the predicate (essentially a boolean C
            expression).

<fun>       is the name of the C function in which the predicate occurs.

<file:line> is the name of the C source file and the line number within
            that file on which the predicate occurs, and is hyperlinked
            to it.
