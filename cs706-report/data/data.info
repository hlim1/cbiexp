4 simple_preds: `wc -l preds.txt`

5 time: time taken for computing complex predicates (in seconds)

6 conj_total: Total conjunctions possible - (n^2 - n) / 2 where n is the number of interesting simple predicates (those found in preds.txt')
7 conj_pdg_metric_pruned: Number of conjunctions pruned by PDG metric 1 (defn. 4.1 in paper)
8 conj_ub_est_pruned: Number of conjunctions pruned by upper bound estimation
9 conj_computed: Number of conjunctions for which the actual score was computed
10 conj_interesting: Number of interesting conjunctions


11 disj_total: Total disjunctions possible - (n^2 - n) / 2 where n is the number of interesting simple predicates (those found in preds.txt')
12 disj_pdg_metric_pruned: Number of disjunctions pruned by PDG metric 1 (defn. 4.1 in paper)
13 disj_ub_est_pruned: Number of disjunctions pruned by upper bound estimation

15 disj_interesting: Number of interesting disjunctions
