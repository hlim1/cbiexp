Oh.. I forgot to mention the format of data.txt.  The columns headings are
not very informative...

Parameters: Application Version SamplingRate Effort

Total: Total complex predicates possible - (n^2 - n) where n is number of
interesting simple predicates i.e. those found in preds.txt
Skipped: No. of complex preds. removed by pruning
Computed: No. of complex preds. not removed by pruning
Interesting: No. of computed complex preds. that are interesting

(As I said, this file belongs to the pre-presentation era.. It has the
data used for all but the sampling charts.. the new analysis produces the
above info for conj.s and disj.s separately... And this data was generated
by a script that aggregates condor job results... It is very much
customized to my root and has a lot of hard-wired paths.. I don't think
anybody can use it without much effort.. I will commit it later)

Top, Bottom: Scores of first and 1000-th complex predicate
PredTop: Score of top simple predicate
Complex_Perf: Number of perfect complex predicates
Simple_Perf: Number of perfect simple predicates
Preds: `wc -l preds.txt`


Complex: Type of top predicate of corrective ranking with complex preds...
simple, conj, disj = 0, 1, 2
PerfComplex: Was that perfect?
Base: corrective ranking without complex-preds... always simple
PerfBase: Was that perfect?
