Put name markers in brackets after items in the to-do list:

  +Foo: things Foo is best suited to work on or plans to work on
  -Foo: things Foo is definitely not able to work on
  *Foo: things Foo is working on right now

If you see a problem but either cannot fix it or don't want to work on
it now, add it to the list below so that it will not be overlooked or
forgotten.  Try to keep to-do items roughly organized by section,
except for whole-paper issues which are listed first.

As you fix outstanding items, remove them from the list and check in
this updated to-do list along with your changes.  When this list is
empty, that basically means we're done!

1. Add clarification/response for the above comment:

>> Can you think of a better term for "interesting" complex predicates.
>> Interesting is a rather anodyne term in this context.

1. Come up with a more suitable term than "interesting"
2. Make sure ALL references to "interesting" are changed.

>> In section 3.4 the claim that bounding the predicates does not affect the
>> results surely has the hidden assumption that an error is caused by a single
>> fault? If so then I think that this should be stated. Naturally errors caused
>> by the co-occurrence of several faults are unlikely, but then they are also the

>> helpful (unless you are sure that it is obvious in which case I've missed
>> something).

6. I completely miss the point here.  Perhaps one of you could clarify the 
question of the comment

>> I was disappointed that the references were not complete (for example 3, 10 and
>> 16, missing volume numbers, parts, and pages).

8. Fill in all the details about citations.
(Honestly, who needs page numbers?)

Done!  Please review

3. Disjunctions are less useful with multiple bugs as we don't know if we are
picking up primary predictors of 2 bugs or a single bug with disjunctive 
predictor.  This is mentioned somewhere.  Revise its text and placement if
necessary.

4. Gosh!  Add that right away.

--  Section 4
--

Section 4 offers some interesting ideas, though they aren't explored
or justified as fully as they could be.  I'm not convinced that
Definition 4.2 is working in the right direction.  If two predicates
are highly correlated according to this definition, doesn't that mean
they are nearly identical and therefore not especially interesting as
a pair?  I would have thought that an interesting pair predicates
would be ones with very little apparent connection in the PDG, but
which nonetheless are tightly connected in how they predict failures.
[+chen]

Choosing predicates with the smallest intersection of predecessor sets also 
relates well with the revised motivation for the metrics; the smaller 
the intersection, the easier it is for a programmer to search the 
code related to both predicates to find the connection.  By the current 
definition "highly correlated" predicate combinations are selected; 
this means a programmer has a potentially huge intersection set to
search through for the item which 1. connects the components and 
2. relates to the bug.
