Find the source locations that contain instrumentation sites but which
were never reached (observed) in any failed run.  Print a list of all
such locations as tab-delimited fields:

	<filename>	<line>	<function>

If multiple sites appear on a line, that line is considered unreached
only if every site on the line is unreached.

Strictly speaking, we cannot guarantee that zero code was executed on
a line appearing in the output.  If there's a convoluted mix of
instrumented and non-instrumented code on the same line, some of the
non-instrumented code may still have run.  Consider:

	foo(); goto bar; baz: if (x) ...;

If branches are instrumented but function calls are not, then even if
the "if (x)" branch was never observed it's still possible that foo()
was called.  I don't expect this to be a problem in practice, though.
