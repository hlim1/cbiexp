<B>TO: </B>Authors Submitting Papers for Publication by ACM<BR>
<B>FROM: </B>ACM Director of Publications<BR>
<B>SUBJECT: </B>ACM Copyright Procedures
<P>
Thank you for submitting a paper for publication by ACM, Inc.  ACM's publications are read throughout 
the world and we must manage requests for reprinting, republishing, redistributing, digitizing, 
posting to servers, translating, anthologizing, and other actions. It is the policy of ACM to own the copyrights on its technical publications to protect the interests of 
ACM, its authors and their employers, and at the same time to facilitate the appropriate reuse of this 
material by others.
<P>
United States Copyright Law requires that the transfer of copyright for each contribution from the 
author to ACM must be confirmed in writing. (See Revised <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_policy/">ACM Interim 
Copyright Policy</A>, sections <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_policy/#Requirement">2.1</A>, <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_policy/#Submission">4.1</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_policy/#Republication">4.2</A>).  It is necessary that authors sign <B>either Part A or Part B</B> of the ACM 
Copyright Form and return it with the manuscript to the publication's Editor at the address on the Form.
<P>
If you are employed and prepared your paper as part of your job, the rights to your paper may initially 
rest with your employer. In that case, when you sign the ACM Copyright Transfer Form, we assume that you 
are authorized to do so by your employer.  If not, the Form should be signed by an authorized person.
<P>
*For jointly authored papers, an original signature is required from one (assumed senior) author only.  
However, we assume that all authors have been advised and have consented to the terms of this Form, and 
this single author acts as duly authorized agent of the others.
<P>
Government employees who prepared the paper as part of their job, or authors whose papers are not copyrightable 
as part of certain Government contract work, are not required to sign Part A, but all co-authors outside the 
Government contract are.*  Part B is to be used instead of Part A only if any or all authors are Government 
employees or the work was performed for a Government agency.
<P>
ACM authors have all the rights historically enjoyed by scientific authors, including the right to present orally 
the submitted (or similar) material in any form; the right to reuse in future works of the author's own with notice 
and credit to ACM; the right to republish in works published by the employer, or for the employer's internal business 
purposes with notice and credit to ACM; the right to reproduce and distribute for peer review in reasonable quantities (see Revised <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_policy/">ACM Interim Copyright Policy</A>,
sections <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_policy/#Authors">3</A>, <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_policy/#Distributions">5.3</A>); 
and they retain all proprietary rights other than copyright.
<P>
Although it is not part of ACM's policy to grant authors or their
organizations the sole right to approve permissions for republishing
by third parties, ACM always seeks the approval of its authors,
for jointly authored papers the first-named (assumed senior) Author
only, in weighing such requests.  This is done as a matter of professional
courtesy.
