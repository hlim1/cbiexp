Each run produces the following output files:


* stamp

Indicates that the run is complete.  Skip any run directory that does
not have this file.


* outcome

The exit status or signal for the run.  0 indicates successful
completion.  Values between 1 and 255 indicate crash due to a fatal
signal, where the value is that signal number.  Values of 256 and up
indicate completion with a nonzero exit status.  Divide by 256 to get
the exact status.


* reports

Raw feedback reports.  This is complete data, with no downsampling.
If you decide to downsample, you may want to save those files in this
same subdirectory so that other people can use them too.

The following recipe may be useful for downsampling raw reports:

    % /moa/sc1/cbi/sampler/tools/decimate-samples 100 <reports >reports-100.gz

The decimation tool takes an optional random number seed, but will
select a good default from system entropy sources if none is provided.
